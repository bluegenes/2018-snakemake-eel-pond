This is a lightweight protocol for assembling up to a few hundred million mRNAseq reads, annotating the resulting assembly, and doing differential expression analysis. The input is short-insert paired-end Illumina reads. This protocol can be run in a single command because it uses the snakemake automated workflow management system.
