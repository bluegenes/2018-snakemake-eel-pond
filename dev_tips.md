# Notes for Advanced Users

Some useful conda, snakemake, workflow hints:

# optional: to make conda isntalls simpler, set up conda configuration
    conda config --set always_yes yes --set changeps1 no
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --add channels defaults
    conda config --add channels bioconda

If you need to modify a conda package, you'll need to work with a local
install of that package. Here's how to use conda to install the dependencies
from the conda recipe.

# install conda-build
     conda install conda-build

# clone the repo of interest and cd into it
     git clone dammit-repo
     cd dammit-repo

# There should be a folder called recipe. 
# Use conda-build to build it.
    conda build recipe

# install the local code (?)
     conda install dammit --use-local
     # or, you can use pip:
     # pip install -e . â€”no-deps
