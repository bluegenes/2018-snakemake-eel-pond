[2018-06-18 14:33:14.602] [jointLog] [info] Thread saw mini-batch with a maximum of 21.05% zero probability fragments
[2018-06-18 14:33:14.610] [jointLog] [info] Computed 112 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-18 14:33:14.610] [jointLog] [info] Counted 48527 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-18 14:33:14.611] [jointLog] [warning] Only 48527 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
