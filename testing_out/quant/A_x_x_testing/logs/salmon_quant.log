[2018-06-18 14:33:20.129] [jointLog] [info] Thread saw mini-batch with a maximum of 41.93% zero probability fragments
[2018-06-18 14:33:20.140] [jointLog] [info] Computed 112 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-18 14:33:20.140] [jointLog] [info] Counted 24289 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-18 14:33:20.141] [jointLog] [warning] Only 24289 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
