[2018-06-18 14:33:17.363] [jointLog] [info] Automatically detected most likely library type as SF








[2018-06-18 14:33:17.914] [jointLog] [info] Thread saw mini-batch with a maximum of 23.44% zero probability fragments
[2018-06-18 14:33:17.922] [jointLog] [info] Computed 109 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-18 14:33:17.922] [jointLog] [info] Counted 75534 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-18 14:33:17.924] [jointLog] [warning] Only 75534 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2018-06-18 14:33:17.924] [jointLog] [info] Mapping rate = 90.4025%
