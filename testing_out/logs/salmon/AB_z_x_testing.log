[2018-06-20 17:28:05.028] [jointLog] [info] Automatically detected most likely library type as U
[2018-06-20 17:28:05.299] [jointLog] [info] Computed 91 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-20 17:28:05.299] [jointLog] [info] Counted 74139 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-20 17:28:05.301] [jointLog] [warning] Only 74139 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
