[2018-06-21 10:50:28.494] [jointLog] [info] Automatically detected most likely library type as SF
[2018-06-21 10:50:28.818] [jointLog] [info] Thread saw mini-batch with a maximum of 29.36% zero probability fragments
[2018-06-21 10:50:28.834] [jointLog] [info] Computed 120 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-21 10:50:28.834] [jointLog] [info] Counted 76133 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-21 10:50:28.835] [jointLog] [warning] Only 76133 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
