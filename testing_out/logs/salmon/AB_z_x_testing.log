[2018-06-20 23:51:50.008] [jointLog] [info] Automatically detected most likely library type as U
[2018-06-20 23:51:50.432] [jointLog] [info] Computed 133 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-20 23:51:50.432] [jointLog] [info] Counted 75051 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-20 23:51:50.435] [jointLog] [warning] Only 75051 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
