[2018-06-20 17:28:07.591] [jointLog] [info] Thread saw mini-batch with a maximum of 0.20% zero probability fragments
[2018-06-20 17:28:07.622] [jointLog] [info] Computed 97 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-20 17:28:07.622] [jointLog] [info] Counted 24011 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-20 17:28:07.625] [jointLog] [warning] Only 24011 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2018-06-20 17:28:07.625] [jointLog] [info] Mapping rate = 89.791%
