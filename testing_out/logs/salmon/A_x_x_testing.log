[2018-06-21 10:50:31.131] [jointLog] [info] Automatically detected most likely library type as ISF
[2018-06-21 10:50:31.131] [jointLog] [info] Thread saw mini-batch with a maximum of 0.18% zero probability fragments
[2018-06-21 10:50:31.155] [jointLog] [info] Computed 132 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-21 10:50:31.155] [jointLog] [info] Counted 25137 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-21 10:50:31.157] [jointLog] [warning] Only 25137 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
