[2018-06-20 23:51:47.625] [jointLog] [info] Automatically detected most likely library type as IU
[2018-06-20 23:51:47.985] [jointLog] [info] Thread saw mini-batch with a maximum of 0.18% zero probability fragments








[2018-06-20 23:51:48.016] [jointLog] [info] Computed 146 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-20 23:51:48.016] [jointLog] [info] Counted 48378 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-20 23:51:48.018] [jointLog] [warning] Only 48378 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
