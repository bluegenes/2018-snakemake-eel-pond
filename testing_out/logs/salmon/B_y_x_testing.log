[2018-06-20 17:28:02.563] [jointLog] [info] Automatically detected most likely library type as IU
[2018-06-20 17:28:02.724] [jointLog] [info] Thread saw mini-batch with a maximum of 0.20% zero probability fragments








[2018-06-20 17:28:02.754] [jointLog] [info] Computed 97 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2018-06-20 17:28:02.754] [jointLog] [info] Counted 48022 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2018-06-20 17:28:02.756] [jointLog] [warning] Only 48022 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2018-06-20 17:28:02.756] [jointLog] [info] Mapping rate = 89.791%
